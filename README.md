This program generates a convex polygon based on randomly generated points, which represent the vertices. Each point is represented by an instance of the Tiger class, with attributes x and y.

Jarvis's Algorithm:
1. Points (x, y) are randomly generated within appropriate ranges.
2. Then, the points are rotated around a chosen central point by a random angle.
3. The point with the smallest y value is selected as the first vertex of the polygon.
4. Subsequent vertices are selected based on the angles between points.
